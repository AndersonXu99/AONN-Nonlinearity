This repository contains the code, data, and supplementary materials for the research paper "Engineering Nonlinear Optical Activation Functions for All-Optical Neural Networks Based on Three-Level Atomic Ensemble". 
The paper presents a novel approach to implementing nonlinear optical activation functions in all-optical neural networks (AONNs) using the nonlinear response of three-level atomic ensembles, specifically via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). 
By leveraging atomic coherence, we explore how optical nonlinearity and quantum interference can be engineered to enhance the efficiency of optical neural network architectures.
